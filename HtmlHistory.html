  <h2>The History of Html</h2>
<p> HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) has been an integral part of the World Wide Web since its inception. It was first introduced by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 while working at CERN, a European research organization. The idea behind HTML was to create a standardized way of sharing scientific information amongst researchers globally.</p>

<p>The first version of HTML, HTML 1.0, was released in 1993, and it allowed users to add basic elements such as headings, paragraphs, and links to their web pages. With the release of HTML 2.0 in 1995, tables and frames were introduced, which gave web designers more control over the layout and design of web pages.</p>

<p>In 1997, HTML 3.2 was released, which added support for style sheets. Style sheets allowed web developers to separate the presentation of a web page from its content, making it easier to maintain and update web pages. With the release of HTML 4.0 in 1997, web developers could create more complex web pages using new elements such as iframes, meta tags, and forms.</p>

<p>In 2000, XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language) was introduced, which was a stricter and more standardized version of HTML. XHTML was designed to be more compatible with XML, making it easier to develop web pages that were compatible with different types of devices.</p>

<p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) was introduced in 1996 as a way to add style and formatting to web pages. <a href="HistoryCss.html">CSS</a> allowed web developers to separate the presentation of a web page from its content, making it easier to update and maintain web pages. CSS has continued to evolve, and the latest version, CSS3, has added new features such as animations, gradients, and transitions.</p>

<p>In conclusion, HTML has come a long way since its inception, and it has played a crucial role in the development of the World Wide Web.
    The addition of style sheets, specifically CSS, has allowed web developers to create visually appealing and user-friendly web pages. HTML and CSS are still essential tools in web development today, and they continue to evolve with advancements in technology.</p>
